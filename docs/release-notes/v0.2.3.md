## 🏔️ v0.2.3 — "Checking the Altimeter"

Quick gear check — turns out the altimeter was reading sea level the whole time. This patch wires up proper version tracking so the app knows where it actually is on the mountain, and can tell you when there's a newer trail map available.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Update Checker Actually Works Now** — The update checker was comparing a hardcoded `1.0` against release tags like `v0.2.2`, which made it think you were already ahead of every release. Now reads the real version and correctly detects when a newer release is available.
- **Version Comparison with Build Metadata** — Fixed version parsing to strip `+commit-sha` build metadata before comparing. No more confused math.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Version on Settings Page** — The app version and build commit now appear in Settings under General. Local dev builds show `0.2.3+dev`, CI builds show `0.2.3+<sha>`.
- **Centralized Version** — App version is now a single source of truth in `Directory.Build.props`, with CI injecting the tag version and commit SHA at build time.
