## 🏔️ v0.2.2 — "Reading the Map"

Halfway up the first pitch and someone realizes the map was upside down. This patch fixes how MAUI Sherpa finds your .NET SDKs — turns out we were checking the snack pocket before the actual gear bag. Now we look where the installers actually put things.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **SDK Detection Overhaul** — Rewrote .NET SDK path resolution to follow the [official install-locations spec](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/install-locations.md). The old code checked `~/.dotnet` (usually just cache files) before system paths, causing missing SDK versions on macOS. Now checks `DOTNET_ROOT` env vars → `/etc/dotnet/install_location` files → default system paths → `~/.dotnet` last.
- **macOS Install Location Files** — Added support for `/etc/dotnet/install_location_arm64` and friends, the official mechanism the `.pkg` installer uses to register where it put .NET. More reliable than guessing.
- **SDK Path Validation** — Candidate paths now must contain an actual `sdk/<version>/dotnet.dll` to count. No more false positives from empty directories or cache folders.

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **Windows Registry Lookup** — Added reading from `HKLM\SOFTWARE\dotnet\Setup\InstalledVersions\<arch>\InstallLocation` for Windows users with custom install locations.
