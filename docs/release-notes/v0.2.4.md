## 🏔️ v0.2.4 — "Tightening the Harness"

Still on the same stretch of trail, but a couple of clips were loose. This patch tightens things up so nothing snags when you pick up the pace.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Provisioning Profile Device Mismatch** — Creating a provisioning profile could send iPhone device IDs to a Mac Catalyst profile (or vice versa), triggering an "Invalid deviceClass" error from Apple. Device selections now clear when switching profile types and are filtered for compatibility before hitting the API.
- **AOT Crash in Release Builds** — The signed Mac Catalyst release was crashing with a JIT error on Apple API calls that use `dynamic`. Enabled the mono interpreter as a fallback so AOT builds gracefully handle reflection-heavy code paths.

*Harness checked, clips secured — ready to keep moving.* 🪢
