## 🏔️ v0.2.1 — "Adjusting the Straps"

You don't get far on a mountain with a pack that doesn't fit. This patch is a quick stop on the trail to tighten a few buckles — a sleeker window, better readability, and smoother scrolling. Nothing flashy, just the kind of adjustments that make the next few miles a lot more comfortable.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Mac Catalyst Titlebar Integration** — The app UI now extends into the macOS titlebar for a cleaner, more native look. Proper drag regions and safe area handling keep everything reachable.
- **Font Size Accessibility** — A new slider in Settings lets you scale the entire UI from 80% to 150%. Every page respects the setting — buttons, inputs, modals, the works.
- **Sidebar Scroll & Auto-Hiding Scrollbars** — The sidebar now scrolls cleanly when it overflows the window, with bottom padding to keep the last item above the Copilot button. Scrollbars hide themselves until you hover.
- **Apple Devices Page Rename** — The "iOS Devices" page header now reads "Apple Devices" — because it always showed more than just iPhones.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Android Emulator Discovery** — Bumped AndroidSdk to v0.27.0 which fixes AVD path resolution and adds a file-system fallback when the Java-based `avdmanager` returns empty results. Emulators that were hiding should now show up.
- **Settings Page Build Fix** — Squashed a stray brace and a leftover service rename that broke the Settings page after a merge.

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **CI Artifact Rename** — Build artifacts are now named `MAUI-Sherpa.zip` / `MAUI-Sherpa.app` for consistency, with commit status links back to the app download.

*A well-fitted pack doesn't slow you down — it disappears. Onward.* 🎒
